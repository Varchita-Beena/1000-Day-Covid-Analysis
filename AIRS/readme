## Why should we look at air pollution?
“For every small increment in air pollution there’s a substantial increase in death,” says Aaron Berstein, the director of the Center for Climate, Health, and Global Environment at Harvard University.<br>
The major outdoor air pollutants are Ozone, Nitrogen Oxides, Carbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide and Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM 10). Cookstoves, coal-fired power plants, car emissions, wildfires, and dust storms are all examples of manmade and natural sources of air pollution.<br>
Air pollution kills an estimated seven million people per year, according to the United Nations, making it one of the most serious environmental health threats of our time. The problem is worsened in low- and middle-income nations, where 98 percent of metropolitan centres with populations of more than 100,000 people fail to satisfy WHO criteria.<br>
Smog is a major source of illness all around the world. The smoggy air that blankets India's cities is often riddled with dangerously high amounts of particulate matter (PM2.5). These pollutants have been related to lung and heart illness, as well as cognitive and immune system impairment. According to a Greenpeace Southeast Asia estimate, PM2.5 air pollution caused roughly 54,000 premature deaths in New Delhi in 2020.
As per WHO (2016) estimates, 10 out of the 20 most populated cities in the world are in India.<br>
